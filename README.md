"This website was created out of a deep passion for football. My interest in the Premier League (EPL) grew significantly after becoming a fan of Tottenham Hotspur and following Son Heung-min's remarkable performances. This project was developed using React and integrates data from the Fantasy Premier League API (fantasy.premierleague.com/api/bootstrap-static) to provide real-time statistics and insights. Through this process, I have gained valuable experience in learning new technologies, solving problems, and working with APIs, which has contributed to my personal and professional growth."
